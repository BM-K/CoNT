# CoNT
This is the [transformers-based](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git) implementation for NeurIPS 2022  paper: *[CoNT: Contrastive Neural Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14690)*.
CoNT is a strong contrastive learning based  text generation model which outperforms the MLE based methods on five generation tasks without modifying the inner model structure and inference efficiency. 

For machine translation task please refer to our fairseq code.
